## Quick start
### Running using Docker
The following was tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04.

    # Get the software from Github
    git clone https://github.com/furthemore/APIS.git
    cd APIS

    # Create .env from template and edit relevant settings (API keys, etc)
    cp example.env .env

    # You’ll need a Square developer account to take payments: https://squareup.com/signup?country_code=us&v=developers
    # If your hosting provider is not configured for a mail relay, you’ll want to populate these lines with SMTP account credentials with e.g. gmail or mailgun.

    # Install make and other necessary utilities
    apt install build-essential

    # Install docker using the instructions at either:
    # https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04 or
    # https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository.

    # Build base docker image:
    make build-base-docker-image

    # Edit Dockerfile and replace the first line with output from last command. (The console will remind you.)

    # Give yourself permission to run Docker commands
    sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
    # Log out and back in to make it take effect

    # Build final image
    make build-docker-image

    # Run in Docker
    docker-compose up -d

    # Docker-compose
    docker-compose exec app /app/manage.py createsuperuser
    # Respond to prompts as needed

    # OPTIONAL: If you intend to run APIS in production, configure your webserver to act as a reverse proxy.
    # Example docs: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-apache-as-a-reverse-proxy-with-mod_proxy-on-ubuntu-16-04

    # Run the development server
    make dev

    # Go to http://localhost:8000/registration/ in a web browser and follow the directions.

### Locally without docker (recommended for developers)

    git clone https://github.com/furthemore/APIS.git
    cd APIS
    python3 -v venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Review your settings
    cp fm_eventmanager/settings.py.devel fm_eventmanager/settings.py

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser

    # Create a self-signed certificate if you want to test or hack on U2F
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
      -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -subj /CN=localhost

    # Get it running (omit --cert localhost for HTTP)
    python manage.py runserver_plus --cert localhost.crt
