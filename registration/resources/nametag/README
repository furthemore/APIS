This directory contains nametag templates for Taxidi to use.
Templates are rendered using the QT implementation of webkit,
and should be tested in a modern webkit browser such as
Chromium, Konquerer, (or Firefox in most cases).

Each template should be in its own directory with an unique
name, along with an accompanying .conf file bearing the same
name as the folder.  This defines default zoom, page size,
margins, etc. and are specific to printer and label types.
The included configurations are specific to the 100x62mm
labels and the default settings for the Brother QL-570.  If
you require different dimensions you will need to use a
different template pack or change the values in the conf file.
A scheme for printer-specific margin settings for overriding
this automatically may be considered for the future, but for
now, patched .conf files will be required for different model
printers.

Creating themes:
The directory should contain at minimum the .conf and
default.html, which defines the base template.  Placeholders
inside the template are formatted like %this%, and accept the
following:

    %date%, %time%      Formatted date and time (per config.)
    %room%, %service%   Room and service of check-in.
    %first%, %last%     Names
    %medical%           Allergies, etc. or volunteer position.
    %code%, %s%         Paging number and security code (%s%)

secure.png, parent-link.png, and parent-secure.png will be
replaced by their respective 1D and/or QR codes - any encoding
can be used and is defined by the client configuration.  The
barcode png's in the template directory are used for previewing
in a browser outside of Taxidi, and are overridden while in
use.

The .conf file is organized by sections, one for each html file.
At least the [default] section is required, however all defines
are optional.  An html file is ignored if it has no section in
this file.  The configuration accepts the following values:

    zoom =      #digit zoom factor (1.00 for 100%)
    height =    #height of page in mm
    width =     #width of page in mm
    left =      #left margin (mm)
    right =     #right margin
    top =       #top margin
    bottom =    #bottom margin
    orientation #print orientation, landscape or portrait
    options =   #comma separated options to pass to wkhtmltopdf

If zoom is undefined, it defaults to 1.  When height and width
are undefined, the default output size is A4.  The margins all
default to 10mm.  Additional options may be passed with the
options = parameter.  For more info about these read the
