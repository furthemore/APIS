        APIS has been successfully set up, but no default event was found.
        APIS uses the values of the default event to control how these pages work,
        and what time each page should be available.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, please <a href="{% url 'admin:registration_event_add' %}">add an event</a>
        and set it as the default in the admin panel.
